# Markov Chain Algorithm Demo

## How to run
1) Clone the repo and open it in IntelliJ
2) Run the project 
3) Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
4) Fill out the form 
   * File to transform is a txt file with text in it
   * Order is a number > 1 but less than Text Length
   * Text Length is also a number > 1 and Order
   * Output File Path is a valid file path on your computer where you want to save the transformed file 
5) Hit Submit
6) Check the output file path for the transformed file

## Improvements to be made
1) Validation. Currently, the form/project has no validation, and can be broken very easily. Validation has to be added, both on the frontend and backend to ensure the code doesn't break. 
2) Replace frontend (it is Thymeleaf right now) with React as it would allow for better UI design in an easier way. This would also make frontend validations easier.
3) Add some unit tests to the project
